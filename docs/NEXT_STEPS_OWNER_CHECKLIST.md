# What You Should Do From Your Side (Owner Checklist)

This checklist is the off-page + operations side required to convert strong technical SEO into ranking gains.

> Important: No agency/tool can honestly guarantee permanent “#1 rank” from on-site code only.

---

## 0) Pre-Deploy Technical Gate (every release)

- Run:
  - `npm run seo:verify:strict`
- Only deploy when the audit passes with zero failures.
- If audit fails, fix reported issues first (canonical, hreflang, sitemap, robots, metadata parity).

---

## 1) Google Business Profile (GBP) — Week 1

- Claim + verify GBP listing.
- Ensure NAP exactly matches website:
  - Name: **Sri Janaki Mahal Trust**
  - Address: **Vasudev Gath, Karsewakpuram, Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh 224123**
  - Phone: **+91 9102319329**
  - Website: **https://www.srijanakimahaltrustofficial.com/**
- Add 15–25 real photos (exterior, rooms, check-in area, dining).
- Publish 1–2 posts/week (festival season: 2–4/week).

---

## 2) Google Search Console (GSC) — Week 1

- Verify property ownership for canonical domain.
- Submit:
  - `sitemap-index.xml`
  - `image-sitemap.xml`
- Review coverage report weekly:
  - fix any “Crawled - currently not indexed” clusters
  - inspect excluded URLs and canonical conflicts

---

## 3) Citation Cleanup — Weeks 1–3

- Create/update listings on trusted platforms (Google, Apple, Bing, relevant India/local directories).
- Merge/remove duplicate listings with wrong phone/name/address.
- Enforce a single canonical NAP everywhere.

---

## 4) Reviews SOP — Ongoing (weekly)

- Ask every real guest for honest feedback (no incentives).
- Respond to all reviews in 24–48 hours.
