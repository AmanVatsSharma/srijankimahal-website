# What You Should Do From Your Side (Owner Checklist)

This checklist is the off-page + operations side required to convert strong technical SEO into ranking gains.

> Important: No agency/tool can honestly guarantee permanent “#1 rank” from on-site code only.

---

## 0) Pre-Deploy Technical Gate (every release)

- Run:
  - `npm run seo:verify:strict`
- Only deploy when the audit passes with zero failures.
- If audit fails, fix reported issues first (canonical, hreflang, sitemap, robots, metadata parity).

---

## 1) Google Search Console (GSC) — Week 1 (must-do)

- Verify property ownership for canonical domain.
- Submit:
  - `sitemap-index.xml`
  - `image-sitemap.xml`
- Review coverage report weekly:
  - fix any “Crawled - currently not indexed” clusters
  - inspect excluded URLs and canonical conflicts
- **Device split check (Desktop vs Mobile)**:
  - compare clicks/impressions/position for `/booking`, `/official-booking`, `/contact-number`

---

## 2) Authority / Backlinks (All‑India) — Ongoing (weekly/monthly)

- Outreach to relevant **national** travel/spiritual sites and guides (avoid paid link farms/PBNs).
- Pitch value pages already built:
  - `/official-booking`, `/contact-number`
  - `/booking-verification-guide`, `/how-to-avoid-scams`
  - `/room-prices`, `/amenities`, `/group-booking`
  - `/gallery`, `/reviews`
- Use natural anchors (“official booking page”, “official contact number”, “booking verification guide”).

---

## 3) Google Business Profile (GBP) — Optional trust layer (Week 1–2)

- Claim + verify GBP listing.
- Ensure NAP exactly matches website:
  - Name: **Sri Janaki Mahal Trust**
  - Address: **Vasudev Gath, Karsewakpuram, Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh 224123**
  - Phone: **+91 9893563047**
  - Website: **https://www.srijanakimahaltrustofficial.com/**
- Keep your GBP/Maps listing link handy: `https://www.google.com/maps?cid=13157769449180505616`
- Add 15–25 real photos (exterior, rooms, check-in area, dining).
- Publish 1–2 posts/week (festival season: 2–4/week).
- Rotate post links (don’t always link only the homepage):
  - `/official-booking`, `/contact-number`, `/room-prices`, `/amenities`, `/group-booking`, `/gallery`, `/reviews`

---

## 4) Reviews SOP — Ongoing (weekly)

- Ask every real guest for honest feedback (no incentives).
- Respond to all reviews in 24–48 hours.
- Handle negative reviews with a factual, calm, non-defensive process.

---

## 5) Content Ops — Ongoing (monthly)

- Publish fresh articles around:
  - festivals
  - travel updates
  - booking safety
  - room/service updates
- Prefer “cluster” content that supports one pillar URL per intent (see `docs/CONTENT_CLUSTERS_V2.md`).
- Keep English and Hindi pages aligned where possible.
- Update old posts with fresh dates and real operational changes.

---

## 7) Conversion + Trust Operations

- Ensure official number is visible in:
  - header/footer
  - booking pages
  - trust/verification pages
- Keep scam-warning and verification pages updated.
- Track leads (calls/WhatsApp) and map them to landing pages monthly.

---

## 8) Weekly Review Rhythm (recommended)

```text
Every Monday:
  - Check GSC coverage + queries
  - Check GBP insights (calls, directions, clicks)
  - Review top pages and click-through changes
  - Update one page + publish one post + add one GBP post
```

---

## 9) 90-Day Success Markers

- Higher impressions for brand + variant queries:
  - sri janki mahal
  - sri janki mahal trust
  - sri janki mahal trust ayodhya
  - shri janki mahal
  - ram janki mahal
- Increased branded clicks in GSC.
- More GBP actions (calls/directions/website clicks).
- Growth in referring domains from relevant sources.
