- Attributes (only true/available)

### Photos & video (recurring)

## 2) Reviews: ethical acquisition SOP (Google compliant)

### Hard rules (never break)
- No incentives (money/discount/free stay) for reviews.
- No “review gating” (don’t ask only happy guests to review).
- No fake reviews (staff/family/farms).
- Never ask users to delete/edit negative reviews.

### Allowed ways to ask (low-pressure)
- **Post-stay WhatsApp follow-up (24–48h)**:
  - Short thank-you + optional review link.
- **QR code at reception/exit**:
  - Sign text: “Share your experience on Google (optional)”.
- **Website link**:
  - A simple “Review us on Google” link/button (only if you have a real GBP review URL).

### Negative review response SOP
- Respond within 24–48h, empathetic tone, no arguments.
- Move sensitive details to private contact.
- Document issue + fix internally; do not promise things you can’t deliver.

## 3) Citations: checklist + tracking

### Where to build citations (categories)
- **Maps**: Google (GBP), Apple Business Connect, Bing Places, HERE
- **India directories**: Justdial, Sulekha, IndiaMART (only if appropriate), local Ayodhya directories
- **Travel** (only if you officially list there): TripAdvisor / travel portals (ensure the listing is controlled + consistent)
- **Religious/pilgrimage directories**: trusted, moderated directories (avoid spam farms)

### Tracking spreadsheet columns (recommended)
- Source | Category | Priority | Listing URL | Status | Name used | Address used | Phone used | Website used | Email used | Last verified | Notes | Action

### Data hygiene rules
- One primary phone across all sources (avoid multiple numbers).
- One primary website URL (HTTPS, canonical domain).
- Avoid duplicate listings; merge/remove duplicates instead.
- No keyword-stuffed business names/descriptions.
