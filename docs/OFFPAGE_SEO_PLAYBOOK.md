## Off‑Page SEO Playbook (All‑India Authority + Backlinks)

**Project**: Sri Janaki Mahal Trust (Ayodhya)  
**Website**: `https://www.srijanakimahaltrustofficial.com/`  
**Last-updated**: 2026-02-24  
**Compliance**: Google Business Profile + Google Search Essentials (no fake reviews, no incentives, no paid link schemes)

## Strategy note (per your request)

Primary goal is **all‑India branded booking traffic** (people searching from any city in India).  
Local signals like GBP/citations are still useful for trust, but **the main ranking lift comes from**:

- strong on-site money pages (booking/contact/official verification)
- strong mobile experience (CWV + UX)
- **nationally relevant backlinks** from real audiences

## Canonical NAP (single source of truth)

Use this exact data everywhere (website, GBP, citations). Track any exception explicitly.

- **Name (preferred)**: Sri Janaki Mahal Trust  
- **Address**: Vasudev Gath, Karsewakpuram, Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh 224123, India  
- **Phone**: +91 9893563047  
- **Email**: srijanakimahaltrustofficial@gmail.com  
- **Website**: `https://www.srijanakimahaltrustofficial.com/`
- **Google Maps / GBP listing URL**: `https://www.google.com/maps?cid=13157769449180505616`

### Name variations policy (to reduce confusion)
- **Primary**: “Sri Janaki Mahal Trust” (use on most platforms)
- **Allowed variations** (only when a platform forces it or when a legacy listing exists):
  - Shri Janaki Mahal Trust
  - Sri Janki Mahal Trust / Shri Janki Mahal Trust
  - Sri Janaki Mahal (only if “Trust” not allowed)
- **Never keyword-stuff** the business name (no “near Ram Mandir”, “best”, “AC rooms”, etc. in the name field).

## 1) Google Business Profile (GBP): optional trust layer

### Setup & verification
- Claim/create GBP in Business Profile Manager.
- Verify using the method offered (postcard / video / phone / email).
- Add team access with least privilege (owner → manager).

### Core fields (must match Canonical NAP)
- Name, address, phone, website
- Pin location accuracy (fix if incorrect)
- Business hours (keep consistent)
- Attributes (only true/available)

### Photos & video (recurring)
- Upload real photos (exterior signage, entry, rooms/common areas, dining/meal area if applicable).
- Add 2–4 new photos per month; remove outdated ones.
- Keep videos short (30–90 seconds), real, no misleading overlays.

### Posts cadence
- 1–2 posts/week (festival season: 2–4/week).
- Use: festival updates, darshan planning tips, booking verification reminders, travel/direction tips.
- **Recommended link rotation** (avoid repeating only 1 URL):
  - `/official-booking` (verification)
  - `/contact-number` (official number)
  - `/room-prices` (tariff ranges)
  - `/amenities` (meals included + facilities)
  - `/group-booking` (yatri mandal / bulk booking)
  - `/gallery` (photos for trust)
  - `/reviews` (review hub → Google Maps listing)
- Templates: `docs/GBP_POST_TEMPLATES.md`

### Q&A management
- Seed 10–15 common FAQs (darshan timing guidance, directions, booking verification).
- Reply within 24–48 hours.

---

## 2) Reviews: ethical acquisition SOP (Google compliant)

### Hard rules (never break)
- No incentives (money/discount/free stay) for reviews.
- No “review gating” (don’t ask only happy guests to review).
- No fake reviews (staff/family/farms).
- Never ask users to delete/edit negative reviews.

### Allowed ways to ask (low-pressure)
- **Post-stay WhatsApp follow-up (24–48h)**:
  - Short thank-you + optional review link.
- **QR code at reception/exit**:
  - Sign text: “Share your experience on Google (optional)”.
- **Website link**:
  - A simple “Review us on Google” link/button using `/reviews` (which points to the verified GBP/Maps listing URL).

### Negative review response SOP
- Respond within 24–48h, empathetic tone, no arguments.
- Move sensitive details to private contact.
- Document issue + fix internally; do not promise things you can’t deliver.

---

## 3) Citations: optional hygiene (do only high-quality)

### Where to build citations (categories)
- **Maps**: Google (GBP), Apple Business Connect, Bing Places, HERE
- **India directories (selective)**: Justdial, Sulekha (only if controlled + consistent)
- **Travel portals (only if you officially list there)**: TripAdvisor / travel portals (avoid duplicates)
- **Religious/pilgrimage directories**: trusted, moderated directories (avoid spam farms)

### Tracking spreadsheet columns (recommended)
- Source | Category | Priority | Listing URL | Status | Name used | Address used | Phone used | Website used | Email used | Last verified | Notes | Action
- Template: `docs/citation-tracker-template.csv`

### Data hygiene rules
- One primary phone across all sources (avoid multiple numbers).
- One primary website URL (HTTPS, canonical domain).
- Avoid duplicate listings; merge/remove duplicates instead.
- No keyword-stuffed business names/descriptions.

## 4) Backlinks: main lever for all‑India SEO

### Best “linkable assets” (already on site)
- Booking verification guide: `/booking-verification-guide`
- Scam prevention: `/how-to-avoid-scams`
- Festival guide: `/festival-booking-guide`

- Room prices: `/room-prices`
- Amenities: `/amenities`
- Group booking: `/group-booking`
- Gallery: `/gallery`
- Reviews hub: `/reviews`
- Blog hub: `/blog` (and Hindi `/hi/blog`)

### Target types (prioritize national reach)
- National travel guides & editorial sites (real traffic, clean outbound links)
- Pilgrimage/spiritual portals (pan-India audience)
- Temple/yatra planning resources & community sites (moderated)
- Transport/travel planning blogs (train/flight + “how to reach Ayodhya”)
- Festival/event coverage sites (seasonal links; rotate to `/official-booking` + `/contact-number`)

### Outreach templates (email)

---

## 5) Reporting (monthly)

Track **actions**, not vanity claims on the website:
- Citations created/updated (count + quality)
- Referring domains gained (quality, relevance)
- GBP: impressions, calls, directions, website clicks
- Review volume + response time

**Important**: Do **not** publish numeric rating claims (“4.8/5”, “5-star”, “thousands of reviews”) on the website unless they are verifiable via a public source and used per Google’s structured data rules.

---

## 6) Impersonation defense (domains + wrong phone numbers)

You confirmed **only** `https://www.srijanakimahaltrustofficial.com/` is official. Do this whenever you find a fake domain/number ranking above you.

### Google reporting

- **Search spam / deceptive pages**: use Google’s spam report form and include:
  - query keyword (example: “sri janki mahal trust contact number”)
  - fake URL(s)
  - proof of official site (this domain) + official phone + screenshots
- Report form: [Google Search spam report](https://search.google.com/search-console/report-spam)

- **Phishing / social engineering**: report via Safe Browsing if the site is collecting money/UPI fraudulently.
- Report form: [Google Safe Browsing (phishing)](https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish)

### Operational checklist (fast)

- Capture evidence: screenshots, phone numbers, payment handles, URLs.
- File reports (Google spam + Safe Browsing).
- Report the domain to its registrar/hosting provider (abuse report).
- Update your GBP “Posts” weekly linking to `/official-booking` + `/contact-number` so users learn the official number directly from Google too.
