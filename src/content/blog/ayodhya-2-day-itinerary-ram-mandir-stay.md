# Ayodhya 2-Day Itinerary (Ram Mandir + Key Temples) + Stay Plan

If you are visiting Ayodhya for the first time, a 2-day plan is ideal: you get peaceful darshan time without rushing, and you can avoid peak-hour crowd stress.

This itinerary is written for devotees who want a clean, simple flow (and a verified stay plan).

## Day 1: Arrival + Ram Mandir + Evening darshan

### 1) Check-in, settle, and confirm timings

- Check-in, freshen up, and keep your ID ready.
- Re-confirm darshan timing and the best entry window for your family group.

If you’re still finalizing your stay, use verified booking channels only:
- Official booking: `/official-booking`
- Booking page: `/booking`
- Official contact number: `/contact-number`

### 2) Ram Mandir darshan (first visit)

Go for darshan once you’re rested. Keep it calm and focused.

### 3) Nearby short visits (time-permitting)

Pick 1–2 sites maximum on Day 1 so you don’t over-walk:
- Hanuman Garhi
- Kanak Bhavan
- Saryu ghat area

## Day 2: Morning darshan + Saryu + departure buffer

### 1) Early morning darshan (second visit)

Morning darshan is usually easier for families and seniors because the day is cooler.

### 2) Saryu / local spiritual circuit

Keep a comfortable pace and allow rest time between locations.

### 3) Departure planning

If you’re leaving by train, this guide helps:
- From Ayodhya Junction to trust: `/location/from-ayodhya-junction`

If you’re coming/going via airport:
- From airport to Ayodhya: `/location/from-airport`

## Stay plan (simple + safe)

For a smoother itinerary:
- Choose a stay location that reduces daily travel (especially if you want multiple darshan visits).
- Keep your booking confirmation saved (screenshot + message thread).
- Avoid third-party agents claiming to represent the trust.
