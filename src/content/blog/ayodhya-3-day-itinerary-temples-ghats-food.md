# Ayodhya 3-Day Itinerary (Ram Mandir + Temples + Saryu) — Practical Plan

If you have 3 days in Ayodhya, you can plan darshan calmly (morning + evening), include Saryu ghat time, and still keep rest time for elders and families.

## Day 1: Arrival + orientation

- Check-in and keep ID proof ready.
- Confirm the safest booking/verification references:
  - `/official-booking`
  - `/contact-number`
- Do a light evening darshan if your arrival time allows.

## Day 2: Full darshan day (recommended)

- Morning darshan: start early to reduce crowd stress.
- Midday rest: avoid pushing too many locations back-to-back.
- Evening darshan: plan an evening slot if you want a calmer experience.

## Day 3: Saryu + local spiritual circuit + departure

- Saryu ghat time (morning/evening based on your schedule).
- Choose 1–2 nearby places only (avoid long “checkbox tourism”).

## Travel + direction help

- From station: `/location/from-ayodhya-junction`
- From airport (commonly Lucknow): `/location/from-airport`
- Location hub: `/location`

## Safe booking checklist (quick)

- Never pay to unknown numbers claiming “agent booking”.
- Ask for a clear confirmation message with dates + room type + total amount.
- If in doubt, follow the scam-prevention pages:
  - `/how-to-avoid-scams`
  - `/booking-verification-guide`

## FAQs

### Is 3 days too much?

No—3 days is ideal if you want multiple darshan sessions without rushing.

### Which pages should I keep saved for verification?

Keep `/official-booking` and `/contact-number`.
