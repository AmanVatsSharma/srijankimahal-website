# Ayodhya Budget Planning: Complete Cost Breakdown and Money-Saving Tips

Planning a pilgrimage to Ayodhya requires careful budget consideration to ensure a comfortable and stress-free experience. Understanding all potential costs—from accommodation and travel to food and darshan arrangements—helps you plan effectively and avoid unexpected expenses. This comprehensive guide breaks down typical costs and offers practical money-saving strategies for your Ayodhya visit.

## Accommodation Costs

Accommodation typically represents the largest portion of your budget. Sri Janaki Mahal Trust offers various room types at different price points. Check the [rooms page](/rooms) to understand pricing for AC and non-AC options. Booking in advance through the [official booking portal](/official-booking) often provides better rates than last-minute arrangements. During festival seasons, prices may vary, so consult the [festival booking guide](/festival-booking-guide) for seasonal pricing information.

## Travel Expenses

Your travel costs depend on your starting location and chosen mode of transportation. If arriving by train, the [location guide from Ayodhya Junction](/location/from-ayodhya-junction) helps you plan local transport costs. For those flying in, check the [airport location guide](/location/from-airport) to estimate taxi or auto-rickshaw fares. The [local transport guide](/blog) provides insights into cost-effective local transportation options within Ayodhya.

## Food and Dining Budget

Meals can be managed cost-effectively by understanding your options. Some accommodations include meal plans, while others require separate dining arrangements. Research nearby dining options through the [location guide](/location) to plan your food budget. Street food and local eateries offer affordable alternatives to restaurant dining, helping you save while experiencing authentic local cuisine.

## Darshan and Temple Expenses

While darshan at Ram Mandir is free, there may be costs for special darshan passes, prasad, or donations. Plan for these expenses in advance. The trust's proximity to Ram Mandir, detailed in the [location guide near Ram Mandir](/location/near-ram-mandir), helps minimize additional travel costs for temple visits.

## Money-Saving Strategies

Booking accommodation well in advance through the [official booking channel](/official-booking) often secures better rates. Avoid peak festival periods if your schedule allows flexibility. Verify all bookings through the [booking verification guide](/booking-verification-guide) to prevent financial losses from scams. Always use the [official contact number](/contact-number) to confirm rates and avoid fraudulent pricing.

## Avoiding Scam-Related Financial Losses

Scams can significantly impact your budget. Follow the [scam prevention guide](/how-to-avoid-scams) to protect your finances. Never pay through unverified channels or personal UPI IDs. Always verify payment details match the [official booking information](/official) before transferring any money.

## Group Travel Cost Benefits

Traveling in groups can reduce per-person costs through shared accommodation. Check the [rooms page](/rooms) for family and group room options that offer better value. Coordinate group bookings through the [official booking portal](/official-booking) to ensure everyone benefits from group rates.
