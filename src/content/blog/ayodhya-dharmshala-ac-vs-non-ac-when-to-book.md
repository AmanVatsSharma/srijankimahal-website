# Ayodhya Dharmshala AC vs Non-AC - When to Book Which?

Choosing between AC and non-AC at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust depends on season, budget, and comfort preference. Here's a practical guide.

## Summer (April–June)

- **AC recommended**: Day temperatures can exceed 40°C. AC helps for rest during afternoon.
- **Non-AC**: Possible if you're out for darshan most of the day and can bear warmer nights.

## Monsoon (July–September)

- **Non-AC often sufficient**: Humidity is high but temperature drops. Cross-ventilation can help.
- **AC**: Useful if you prefer controlled humidity and temperature.

## Winter (October–March)

- **Non-AC ideal**: Cool, pleasant weather. Most pilgrims find non-AC comfortable.
- **AC**: Optional; some prefer heating; check if rooms have heating.

## Cost Difference

AC rooms typically cost more than non-AC. See [room types and prices](/rooms) for current rates. For budget stays, non-AC in winter is a common choice.

## Festival Period

During Ram Navami, Diwali, etc., both AC and non-AC fill quickly. Book early via [official booking](/official-booking) or [contact](/contact-number). Use the [festival booking guide](/festival-booking-guide) for planning.
