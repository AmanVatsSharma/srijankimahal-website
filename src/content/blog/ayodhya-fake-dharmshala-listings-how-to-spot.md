# Ayodhya Fake Dharmshala Listings - How to Spot & Avoid Fraud

Scammers create fake listings using the names of popular dharmshalas like Sri Janaki Mahal Trust. This guide helps you spot fraud and book safely.

## Common Fake Listing Tactics

1. **Fake websites**: URLs that look similar to the official site but use different domains.
2. **Social media ads**: Promotions with "discounts" and personal numbers—never the official +91 9893563047.
3. **Travel aggregators**: Unauthorized listings on OTAs claiming to offer trust rooms.
4. **WhatsApp forwards**: Messages from unknown numbers posing as "official" or "partner" agents.

## Red Flags

- Contact number different from **+91 9893563047**
- Payment to personal UPI IDs or individual names
- No trust-stamped confirmation
- Urgency tactics: "Pay now or room will go"
- Prices much lower than [official room rates](/rooms)

## How to Verify Sri Janaki Mahal Trust

1. **Official contact**: Only +91 9893563047 (call/WhatsApp) and srijanakimahaltrustofficial@gmail.com
2. **Website**: https://www.srijanakimahaltrustofficial.com
3. **Confirmation format**: Check the [booking verification guide](/booking-verification-guide) for how a real confirmation looks
4. **Payment beneficiary**: Must be **Sri Janaki Mahal Trust** or **Janaki Mahal Trust Ayodhya**
