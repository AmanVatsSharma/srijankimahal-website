# Ayodhya Family Trip with Kids (Darshan + Stay + Safety) — Practical Tips

Ayodhya can be very family-friendly if you plan with **short walking blocks**, **snack/water breaks**, and **simple verification for booking**.

## 1) Darshan timing for kids

- Prefer morning time (cooler + calmer).
- Avoid stacking too many attractions in one day.

## 2) What to carry

- Water + ORS (as needed)
- Light snacks for kids
- Minimal bags (carry only essentials)
- ID proofs for adults

## 3) Stay plan that reduces daily travel

Less travel = happier kids:
- Rooms: `/rooms`
- Location guides: `/location`

## 4) Verified booking only (very important)

Use official pages:
- `/official-booking`
- `/contact-number`
And keep scam-prevention references:
- `/how-to-avoid-scams`
- `/booking-verification-guide`

## FAQs

### Can we do multiple darshan visits with children?

Yes—if your stay reduces commute time and you keep rest breaks.

### How do we avoid fake booking agents?

Only book/verify via the official pages and official contact number on this website.
