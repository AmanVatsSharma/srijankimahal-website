# Ayodhya First-Time Visitor Mistakes to Avoid (Darshan + Stay + Booking)

## Mistake 1: Trying to do everything in one day

Keep your plan calm. Use a 2-day plan if possible:
- `/blog/ayodhya-2-day-itinerary-ram-mandir-stay`

## Mistake 2: Not verifying booking before paying

Always verify:
- `/official-booking`
- `/contact-number`
- `/how-to-avoid-scams`

## Mistake 3: No buffer time

Crowds and security checks can add time—keep buffers for elders/kids.
