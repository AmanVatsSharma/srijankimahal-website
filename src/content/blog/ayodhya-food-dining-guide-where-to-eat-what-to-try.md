Understanding dining options, food safety, and what to try helps you enjoy authentic local flavors while maintaining your health and dietary preferences. This guide covers recommended eateries, local specialties, and practical dining tips for your Ayodhya visit.

## Local Cuisine and Specialties

## Food Safety and Hygiene

Food safety is important, especially when trying street food or eating at smaller establishments. Choose vendors and restaurants that maintain visible hygiene standards. Look for places with good customer traffic, as this often indicates freshness. Avoid raw salads or cut fruits from street vendors if you have a sensitive stomach. Stay hydrated with bottled or filtered water.

## Meal Timing and Temple Visits

Plan your meals around your temple visit schedule. Many pilgrims prefer to have darshan on an empty stomach or after a light meal. Early morning darshan visits may require adjusting breakfast timing.

Carry snacks that meet your dietary needs as backup options.
