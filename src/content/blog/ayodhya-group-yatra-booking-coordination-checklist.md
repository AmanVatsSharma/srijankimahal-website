# Ayodhya Group Yatra Booking Checklist (Coordinator + Room Plan + Verification)

For group yatras, the biggest problem is confusion: multiple callers, mixed dates, and unclear room requirements. Use this checklist to keep it simple.

## 1) Appoint one coordinator

- One phone number for all communication.
- One message thread for confirmation and changes.

## 2) Share clear guest + date details

- Check-in/check-out dates
- Total guests + elderly/kids count
- Room preference (2/3/4 bed, AC/Non-AC)

## 3) Use verified booking channels only

- `/official-booking`
- `/contact-number`
- Scam checklist: `/how-to-avoid-scams`

## 4) Save your confirmation

Keep screenshot + details ready for check-in.
