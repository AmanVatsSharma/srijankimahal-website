# Ayodhya Junction vs Other Stations — Which One Should You Choose?

Travelers often see multiple station names while booking tickets. The best station depends on your train route and convenience.

## A practical way to decide

- Pick the station that gives you the most reliable train timing on your route.
- Prefer a station with easier last-mile transport for your group.

## After you arrive: verified last-mile directions

Use the route guide:
- `/location/from-ayodhya-junction`

And for the overall location hub:
- `/location`

## Safe planning note

If any third party claims to “handle booking + pickup”, verify first:
- `/official-booking`
- `/contact-number`
- `/how-to-avoid-scams`
