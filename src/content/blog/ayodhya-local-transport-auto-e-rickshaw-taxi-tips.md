# Ayodhya Local Transport Tips (Auto, E-Rickshaw, Taxi) — Safe + Practical

Local transport in Ayodhya is usually manageable if you keep directions clear and avoid last-minute confusion.

## Common options

- **Auto-rickshaw**: good for short distances
- **E-rickshaw**: sometimes convenient in busy zones
- **Taxi/cab**: better for families and luggage

## Practical tips

- Clearly state your destination: “Sri Janaki Mahal Trust, Karsewakpuram (near Ram Mandir)”.
- Keep your location page handy:
  - `/location`
  - `/location/from-ayodhya-junction`
  - `/location/from-airport`

## Safety + scam prevention

If someone pushes “agent booking + transport”, verify first:
- `/contact-number`
- `/official-booking`
- `/how-to-avoid-scams`
