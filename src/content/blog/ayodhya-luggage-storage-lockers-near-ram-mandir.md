# Ayodhya Luggage Storage & Lockers Near Ram Mandir (Pilgrim Guide)

Managing luggage during darshan or between check-in and check-out can be tricky. Here's what to expect in Ayodhya and at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust.

## At Sri Janaki Mahal Trust

- **In-room storage**: Rooms have space for bags; keep valuables with you or in locked bags
- **Early arrival**: If you arrive before check-in, staff may hold luggage in a secure area
- **After check-out**: Ask if you can leave bags briefly while you do final darshan—subject to availability

Contact the [official number](/contact-number) to confirm current policies.

## Near Ram Mandir / Darshan Area

- **Cloakrooms**: Some facilities may offer luggage storage for pilgrims—check signage at the Mandir approach
- **Regulations**: Electronics and certain items may not be allowed inside; plan accordingly
- **Crowds**: During peak times, storage areas may be full—travel light when possible

## General Tips

1. **Minimize luggage**: Carry only essentials for darshan
2. **Room as base**: Use your [booked room](/official-booking) at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust as your luggage base
3. **Valuables**: Keep money, phone, and ID on your person
4. **Groups**: Designate someone to watch bags if using common areas
