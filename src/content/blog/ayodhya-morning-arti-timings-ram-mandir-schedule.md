# Ayodhya Morning Arti Timings - Ram Mandir Schedule & Janaki Mahal Stay

Attending morning aarti at Ram Mandir is a highlight for many pilgrims. Here's how to plan with a stay at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust.

## Ram Mandir Aarti Schedule

Aarti timings may vary by season and temple rules. Typically:
- **Morning aarti**: Around 4–5 AM (approximate—check current schedule)
- **Other aartis**: Multiple aartis through the day
- **Saryu aarti**: Evening—see [Saryu aarti guide](/blog/ayodhya-saryu-aarti-guide-timings-etiquette)

**Confirm current timings** at the temple or with the trust when you arrive.

## Advantage of Staying at Janaki Mahal

Sri Janaki Mahal Trust is in Karsewakpuram, **walking distance** to Ram Mandir. You can:
- Wake early, bathe, and walk to the temple
- Avoid transport hassles at dawn
- Return for breakfast at the trust—meals are included; see [meals guide](/blog/sri-janaki-mahal-trust-meals-food-guide)

## Tips for Morning Aarti

- **Reach early**: Queues form before aarti
- **Dress modestly**: Follow [cultural etiquette](/blog/ayodhya-cultural-etiquette-dress-code-guide)
