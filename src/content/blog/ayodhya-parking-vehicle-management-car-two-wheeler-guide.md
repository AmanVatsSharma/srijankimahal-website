# Ayodhya Parking and Vehicle Management: Car and Two-Wheeler Guide

Traveling to Ayodhya by private vehicle offers flexibility and convenience, but requires planning for parking and vehicle management. Understanding available parking facilities, regulations, and best practices helps ensure your vehicle's security and your peace of mind during your pilgrimage. This guide covers parking options, vehicle management tips, and practical considerations for car and two-wheeler travelers.

## Parking Facilities Near Accommodations

Many accommodations in Ayodhya offer parking facilities, but availability and capacity vary. When booking accommodation through the [official booking portal](/official-booking), inquire about parking availability and any associated charges. Some facilities provide secure parking, while others may have limited or street parking options. Verify parking details through the [official contact number](/contact-number) before your visit.

## Parking Near Ram Mandir

Due to high foot traffic and security measures, parking directly near Ram Mandir is limited. Designated parking areas are available at a distance, and visitors typically walk or use local transport for the final approach. If staying at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust, check the [location guide near Ram Mandir](/location/near-ram-mandir) to understand parking options and walking distances. Plan to use your vehicle for reaching your accommodation, then rely on local transport or walking for temple visits.

## Two-Wheeler Parking Considerations

Two-wheelers offer more parking flexibility than cars, with many accommodations able to accommodate motorcycles and scooters. Secure parking is still important, so verify parking security when booking through the [official booking portal](/official-booking). Two-wheelers can access narrower lanes and may find parking closer to accommodations, but always use designated parking areas and follow local regulations.

## Vehicle Security Tips

Vehicle security is crucial during your stay. Choose accommodations with secure, monitored parking when possible. Never leave valuables visible in your vehicle. Park in well-lit, designated areas rather than isolated spots. If your accommodation doesn't provide secure parking, research nearby paid parking facilities through the [location guide](/location).

## Parking Fees and Regulations

Parking fees vary by location and facility type. Some accommodations include parking in their rates, while others charge separately. Public parking areas near major attractions typically charge hourly or daily rates. Verify parking costs when booking accommodation through the [official booking portal](/official-booking) or by contacting the [official contact number](/contact-number) to avoid surprises.

## Alternative Transportation Strategies

Consider using your vehicle primarily for reaching Ayodhya, then relying on local transport for daily temple visits and exploration. This reduces parking challenges and allows you to experience local transportation. Auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, and taxis are readily available and can be more convenient for navigating crowded areas near temples.

## Planning Your Arrival

When planning your arrival, research parking availability at your accommodation. If arriving by train at Ayodhya Junction, you might prefer to use local transport rather than bringing a vehicle, as detailed in the [location guide from Ayodhya Junction](/location/from-ayodhya-junction). For those driving, verify that your accommodation can accommodate your vehicle type and size.

## Vehicle Maintenance and Emergency Services

Before your trip, ensure your vehicle is in good condition for the journey. Research local vehicle service centers and emergency towing services in case of breakdowns. Keep important documents like registration, insurance, and driver's license accessible. If you encounter vehicle issues during your stay, your accommodation staff may be able to recommend local service providers.
