# Ayodhya Pilgrimage Booking 3 Months in Advance - Tips & Why It Matters

For festival visits like Ram Navami, Diwali, or long weekends, rooms at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust fill up months ahead. Booking 3 months in advance greatly improves your chances of securing a comfortable stay near Ram Mandir.

## Why 3 Months?

- **High demand**: Ayodhya receives millions of pilgrims during key festivals.
- **Limited rooms**: Trust dharmshalas have fixed capacity; once full, there’s no overflow.
- **Peace of mind**: Early confirmation means you can plan travel, leave, and darshan without last-minute stress.

The [festival booking guide](/festival-booking-guide) explains which dates require the earliest booking.

## How to Book 3 Months Ahead

1. **Identify your dates**: Check festival calendars (Ram Navami, Diwali, etc.) and plan around them.
2. **Contact early**: Use the [official booking page](/official-booking) or [contact number](/contact-number) as soon as your dates are fixed.
3. **Be specific**: Share check-in, check-out, number of guests, and room preference (AC/non-AC).
4. **Verify confirmation**: Follow the [booking verification guide](/booking-verification-guide) and only pay through official channels. Avoid [scams](/how-to-avoid-scams).

## Room Choices When Booking Early

Advance booking gives you time to choose the right room. See [room types and prices](/rooms) for AC, non-AC, 2-bed, 3-bed, and family options. Families and groups should book early to get adjoining or suitable rooms.

## If You’re Booking Late

If you missed the 3-month window, still contact the [official number](/contact-number). Waitlists and cancellations sometimes free up rooms. Avoid unverified agents who claim "guaranteed" festival rooms—these are often scams.
