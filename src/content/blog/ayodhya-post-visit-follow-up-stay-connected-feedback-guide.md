# Ayodhya Post-Visit Follow-Up: Staying Connected and Feedback Guide

Your connection with Ayodhya doesn't end when your pilgrimage concludes. Staying connected, providing feedback, and sharing your experience can enhance your spiritual journey and help future pilgrims. This guide covers ways to maintain your connection with Ayodhya, provide constructive feedback to accommodations, and continue your spiritual practice after returning home.

## Providing Accommodation Feedback

Sharing your experience helps accommodations improve their services and assists future pilgrims in making informed decisions. If you stayed at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust, you can provide feedback through the [official contact number](/contact-number). Be constructive and specific in your feedback, mentioning both positive aspects and areas for improvement. Your input helps maintain service quality and supports the trust's mission of serving pilgrims.

## Staying Connected Through Official Channels

Follow official social media channels if available to stay updated on news, events, and special offerings. This helps you plan future visits and stay connected to the Ayodhya community.

## Sharing Your Experience Responsibly

Sharing your pilgrimage experience can inspire others and help them plan their own visits. When sharing on social media or review platforms, be respectful and accurate. Focus on your personal experience rather than making broad claims. If recommending the accommodation, direct others to the [official booking portal](/official-booking) to ensure they book through legitimate channels and avoid scams, as outlined in the [scam prevention guide](/how-to-avoid-scams).

## Continuing Spiritual Practice at Home

Your Ayodhya pilgrimage can inspire ongoing spiritual practice at home. Create a dedicated space for prayer and meditation that reminds you of your visit. Continue reading and studying about Ramayana and Ayodhya's significance. Share your experience with family and friends, potentially inspiring their own spiritual journeys.

Share accurate information about booking processes, directing people to the [official booking portal](/official-booking) and [official contact channels](/official). Help others avoid scams by sharing knowledge from the [scam prevention guide](/how-to-avoid-scams).

## Documenting Your Experience

Keep a journal or photo album of your pilgrimage experience. This personal documentation helps preserve memories and can be shared with family members who couldn't join you.
