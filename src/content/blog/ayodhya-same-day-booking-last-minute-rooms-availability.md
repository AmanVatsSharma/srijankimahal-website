# Ayodhya Same-Day Booking & Last-Minute Rooms Availability (2025 Guide)

Planning an unplanned visit to Ayodhya? Same-day and last-minute room bookings can be challenging but are sometimes possible. This guide explains how to check real-time availability, what to expect during peak periods, and how to book only through verified channels.

## Is Same-Day Booking Possible at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust?

Yes, when rooms are available. Cancellations and no-shows create occasional openings. The trust updates availability throughout the day. The best way to check is by contacting the [official booking number](/contact-number) or using [official booking channels](/official-booking). Avoid third-party sites—they may show outdated data.

## Best Times to Try Last-Minute Bookings

- **Early morning (6–9 AM)**: Cancellations from the previous night are often processed.
- **24–48 hours before check-in**: Many pilgrims cancel due to travel changes.
- **Weekdays**: Lower demand than weekends and festivals.
- **Off-peak months**: Oct–Mar (excluding major festivals) tend to have better last-minute availability.

For festival dates, see the [festival booking guide](/festival-booking-guide) to understand when rooms fill up months in advance.

## Verified Channels Only

Always book through the [official booking page](/official-booking) or the [verified contact number](/contact-number). Scammers target last-minute travelers. Follow the [how to avoid scams guide](/how-to-avoid-scams) and never pay via unverified UPI IDs or personal numbers.

## Room Type Flexibility

If your preferred room type is unavailable, consider alternatives. Check [room types and prices](/rooms) to understand AC vs non-AC and bed options. Flexibility improves your chances of securing a stay.

## What to Do If No Rooms Are Available

If Sri Janaki Mahal Trust is full, ask the [official contact](/contact-number) for waitlist options or nearby trusted alternatives. Never fall for fake listings—always verify through [official verification](/official).
