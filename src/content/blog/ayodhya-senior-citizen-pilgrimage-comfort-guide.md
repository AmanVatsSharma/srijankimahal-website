# Ayodhya Senior Citizen Pilgrimage Guide (Comfort + Darshan + Stay Tips)

For senior citizens, a peaceful Ayodhya visit depends on three things: **timing**, **rest**, and **reducing travel friction**.

## 1) Timing strategy

- Prefer **early morning** darshan (cooler, usually smoother).
- Keep an evening option only if energy allows.

## 2) Rest-first itinerary

- Plan **1 major darshan block** + **1 light block** per day.
- Keep a buffer for meals, hydration, and seating breaks.

## 3) Reduce daily travel

Choose a stay plan that reduces repeated commuting:
- Rooms: `/rooms`
- Location: `/location`

## 4) Safe booking (avoid agents)

Always verify using:
- `/official-booking`
- `/contact-number`
- Scam prevention: `/how-to-avoid-scams`

## FAQs
