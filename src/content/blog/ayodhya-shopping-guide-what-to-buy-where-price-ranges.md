# Ayodhya Shopping Guide: What to Buy, Where to Shop, and Price Ranges

Shopping in Ayodhya offers opportunities to purchase religious items, souvenirs, and local handicrafts that serve as meaningful mementos of your pilgrimage. Understanding what to buy, where to find authentic products, and typical price ranges helps you shop wisely and avoid overpaying. This guide covers popular shopping items, recommended shopping areas, and practical tips for making informed purchases.

## Religious Items and Prasad

Religious items like rudraksha malas, prayer beads, small idols, and prasad are popular purchases. These items are available near major temples and along the ghats. Prices vary based on material quality and size, typically ranging from ₹50-500 for basic items to ₹1000-5000 for premium pieces. Shop near Ram Mandir and other major temples, but compare prices at multiple stalls before purchasing.

## Local Handicrafts and Textiles

Ayodhya and the surrounding region offer traditional handicrafts and textiles. Look for handwoven fabrics, traditional clothing, and local artwork. Prices depend on craftsmanship and materials, with simple items starting around ₹200 and intricate pieces costing ₹2000-10000 or more. Visit dedicated handicraft shops rather than street vendors for better quality assurance.

## Books and Religious Literature

Religious books, scriptures, and literature about Ramayana and Ayodhya's history are meaningful purchases. Bookshops near temples offer various options, with prices typically ranging from ₹50-500 for small books to ₹500-2000 for comprehensive volumes. These make excellent gifts and personal study materials.

## Souvenirs and Memorabilia

Small souvenirs like keychains, magnets, photo frames, and decorative items featuring Ram Mandir or Ayodhya themes are popular keepsakes. These are widely available near tourist areas and typically cost ₹20-200 depending on size and quality. Shop around to find the best prices, as similar items may vary significantly between vendors.

## Shopping Areas Near Your Accommodation

If staying at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust, check the [location guide](/location) to identify nearby shopping areas. The trust's proximity to Ram Mandir, detailed in the [location guide near Ram Mandir](/location/near-ram-mandir), provides easy access to shopping areas around the temple. Plan your shopping trips to avoid carrying heavy items during darshan visits.

## Budget Planning for Shopping

Allocate a separate budget for shopping to avoid overspending. Research typical price ranges before your visit to recognize fair pricing. When booking accommodation through the [official booking portal](/official-booking), factor shopping expenses into your overall budget planning. Keep receipts for significant purchases and verify authenticity of expensive items.

## Avoiding Shopping Scams

Be cautious of vendors offering "special deals" or claiming items are "blessed" to justify higher prices. Compare prices at multiple shops before making purchases. Avoid buying from vendors who approach you aggressively or claim limited-time offers. Use the same caution you apply to accommodation bookings, following principles from the [scam prevention guide](/how-to-avoid-scams).

## Authenticity and Quality Tips

For religious items, purchase from established shops near temples rather than random street vendors. Check craftsmanship quality, especially for handicrafts and textiles. For books, verify publishers and ensure content accuracy. When in doubt, ask locals or your accommodation staff for recommendations on reputable shops.
