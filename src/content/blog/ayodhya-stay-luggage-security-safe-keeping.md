# Ayodhya Stay - Luggage Security & Safe Keeping Tips for Pilgrims

Keeping your luggage and valuables secure ensures a stress-free pilgrimage. Here are practical tips for guests at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust.

## In-Room Security

- **Lock your room** when you leave
- **Valuables**: Keep cash, cards, phone, and documents on your person or in a small locked bag
- **Don’t display** large amounts of cash or expensive items
- **Group stays**: Designate someone to stay when others go for darshan, or rotate

## During Darshan

Ram Mandir and temple areas may not allow bags. Use:
- [Luggage storage](/blog/ayodhya-luggage-storage-lockers-near-ram-mandir) if available
- Your room at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust as base—leave non-essentials behind
- A small waist pouch or bag for phone, money, and ID

## Trust Facility

The trust provides basic security. Lock rooms, don’t leave doors open, and report any concern to staff. Contact the [official number](/contact-number) for specific policies.

## General Tips

1. **Minimize** what you carry—leave unnecessary items at home
2. **Photocopies**: Keep copies of ID and booking; originals in a safe place
3. **Insurance**: Consider travel insurance for valuable items
4. **Emergency**: Save [emergency contacts](/blog/ayodhya-emergency-contacts-helpline-numbers) and the trust number
