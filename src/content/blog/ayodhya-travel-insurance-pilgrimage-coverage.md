# Ayodhya Travel Insurance - Pilgrimage Coverage & What to Consider

Travel insurance can protect your Ayodhya pilgrimage. Here's what to consider and how it relates to your stay at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust.

## Why Consider Insurance

- **Trip cancellation**: Illness or emergency may force last-minute cancellation—see [cancellation policy](/cancellation-refund)
- **Medical**: Accidents or illness during travel
- **Luggage**: Lost or delayed baggage
- **Elderly travelers**: Especially useful for seniors—see [senior citizen guide](/blog/ayodhya-senior-citizen-pilgrimage-comfort-guide)

## What to Look For

- **Cancellation cover**: Reimbursement if you cancel for covered reasons
- **Medical cover**: Emergency treatment, hospitalization
- **Age limits**: Some policies have age caps—check for senior citizens
- **Pre-existing conditions**: Declare if required

## Booking Your Stay

Sri Janaki Mahal Trust has its own [cancellation and refund policy](/cancellation-refund). Insurance does not replace it—insurance may reimburse you; the trust’s policy governs their refund. Book via [official booking](/official-booking) or [contact](/contact-number).

## General Tips

- Buy from reputable insurers
- Read terms, especially exclusions
- Keep policy details and emergency numbers handy—see [emergency contacts](/blog/ayodhya-emergency-contacts-helpline-numbers)
