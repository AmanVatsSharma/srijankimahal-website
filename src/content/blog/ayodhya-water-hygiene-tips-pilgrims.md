# Ayodhya Water and Hygiene Tips for Pilgrims

Maintaining proper hygiene and ensuring safe water consumption are crucial for a healthy and comfortable pilgrimage to Ayodhya. Water quality, sanitation facilities, and personal hygiene practices can significantly impact your visit experience. This guide provides essential water safety and hygiene tips to help you stay healthy during your Ayodhya pilgrimage.

## Safe Drinking Water Practices

Always drink bottled water or filtered water from reliable sources. Avoid tap water unless you're certain it's been properly treated. Many accommodations provide safe drinking water, so check with your stay about water availability. If staying at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust, inquire about water facilities when booking through the [official booking portal](/official-booking). Carry a reusable water bottle and refill it from trusted sources to stay hydrated throughout your visit.

## Water Purification Options

If you need to use tap water, consider carrying water purification tablets or a portable water filter. Boiling water is an effective method if facilities are available at your accommodation. Some accommodations provide filtered water dispensers for guests. When booking accommodation, verify water facilities through the [official contact number](/contact-number) to ensure you have access to safe drinking water.

## Hand Hygiene and Sanitization

Maintain regular handwashing with soap and water, especially before meals and after visiting temples or public areas. Carry hand sanitizer for situations where soap and water aren't immediately available. Temple visits involve touching various surfaces, so hand hygiene is particularly important. Sanitize your hands after handling money, using public facilities, or touching common surfaces.

## Public Restroom Facilities

Public restrooms are available throughout Ayodhya, especially near temples and tourist areas. Some may require a small fee. Carry tissues or toilet paper as backup, as facilities may not always provide it. Use restrooms at your accommodation when possible, as they're typically better maintained. If staying at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust, check the [location guide](/location) to identify nearby facilities.

## Food and Water Safety

When eating out, choose restaurants and vendors that maintain visible hygiene standards. Avoid raw salads or cut fruits from street vendors if you have a sensitive stomach. Drink only bottled or filtered beverages. Ice in drinks may be made from tap water, so be cautious with ice-cold beverages. Stick to hot, freshly prepared food when possible, as heat helps kill bacteria.

## Personal Hygiene During Temple Visits

Temple visits involve removing footwear and walking barefoot in some areas. Wash your feet thoroughly after temple visits, especially before meals or returning to your accommodation. Carry wet wipes for quick cleaning when water isn't immediately available. Maintain cleanliness of your hands and feet throughout the day to prevent infections.

## Accommodation Hygiene Standards

Choose accommodations that maintain good hygiene standards. When booking through the [official booking portal](/official-booking), inquire about cleanliness and sanitation facilities. Verify accommodation standards through the [booking verification guide](/booking-verification-guide) to ensure you're staying at a reputable place. Accommodations like Sri Janaki Mahal Trust maintain proper hygiene standards, as detailed in their [official information](/official).

## Staying Hydrated in Ayodhya's Climate

Ayodhya's climate can be warm, especially during summer months. Stay well-hydrated by drinking water regularly throughout the day. Avoid excessive consumption of caffeinated or sugary drinks, as they can contribute to dehydration. Carry a water bottle during temple visits and sightseeing. Plan your [itinerary](/blog/ayodhya-2-day-itinerary-ram-mandir-stay) to include regular hydration breaks.

## Hygiene Products to Carry

Pack essential hygiene products including hand sanitizer, wet wipes, tissues, soap, and a small towel. These items are especially useful during temple visits and when using public facilities. Consider carrying a small first-aid kit with basic supplies. Having these items readily available helps maintain hygiene standards throughout your visit.

## Health Precautions and Awareness

Be aware of common health issues that can arise from poor hygiene or contaminated water. Symptoms like stomach upset, diarrhea, or dehydration should be addressed promptly. If you experience health issues, seek medical attention. Ayodhya has medical facilities, and your accommodation can guide you to the nearest healthcare provider. Keep emergency contacts handy, as detailed in emergency contact guides.
