# Does Janaki Mahal Trust Allow Pets?

Sri Janaki Mahal Trust typically does not allow pets, as it is a dharmshala for pilgrims. Confirm current policy with [official contact](/contact-number).

## General Expectation

Most dharmshalas in Ayodhya do not permit pets due to shared spaces and hygiene.

## Alternatives

If you travel with a pet, look for pet-friendly accommodations elsewhere and visit Ram Mandir during the day. Sri Janaki Mahal remains an option for pet-free stays.

## Book Your Stay

Book via [official booking](/official-booking) or [contact number](/contact-number). See [rooms](/rooms).
