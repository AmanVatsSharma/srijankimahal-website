# How to Reschedule Your Booking at Janaki Mahal Trust (Step-by-Step)

Plans change—travel dates, health, or family situations may require you to reschedule your stay at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust. Here’s how to request a date change safely.

## Reschedule Policy Overview

The trust allows rescheduling subject to availability and the [cancellation and refund policy](/cancellation-refund). Contact as early as possible—last-minute changes may not always be possible, especially during peak season.

## Step 1: Contact Official Channels

Reach out only through:
- **Phone/WhatsApp:** +91 9893563047
- **Email:** srijanakimahaltrustofficial@gmail.com

Details are on the [contact number page](/contact-number). Never use third-party agents or unverified numbers—see [how to avoid scams](/how-to-avoid-scams).

## Step 2: Provide Booking Details

Include in your message:
- Your original booking ID or confirmation reference
- Current check-in and check-out dates
- Requested new check-in and check-out dates
- Your registered contact number

## Step 3: Wait for Confirmation

Staff will check availability for your new dates and respond. If possible, you'll receive an updated confirmation. If not, they may suggest alternative dates or explain options under the [cancellation-refund policy](/cancellation-refund).

## Peak Season Considerations

During festivals (Ram Navami, Diwali, etc.), availability for new dates is limited. Book early and use the [festival booking guide](/festival-booking-guide) to plan. Rescheduling from one peak period to another may not always be feasible.

## After Rescheduling

Once confirmed, save the new confirmation message. Follow the [booking verification guide](/booking-verification-guide) to ensure the updated details are correct. Pay any difference if room rates differ for the new dates.
