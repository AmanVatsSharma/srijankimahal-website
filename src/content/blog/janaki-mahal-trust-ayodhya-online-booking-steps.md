# Janaki Mahal Trust Ayodhya Online Booking Steps - Official Walkthrough

Prefer booking from your phone or laptop? The **Janaki Mahal Trust** (also called **Sri Janki Mahal Trust** and **Shri Janki Mahal Trust Ayodhya**) offers a secure online process. Follow this official walkthrough to confirm your stay without travelling to the reception.

> Flow Chart: Visit official channels → Fill booking template → Receive confirmation slip → Pay securely → Travel to Ayodhya with trust support.

## Step 1: Visit Official Website or WhatsApp Link

- Website: [https://www.srijanakimahaltrustofficial.com](https://www.srijanakimahaltrustofficial.com)
- WhatsApp Booking: [https://wa.me/919102319329](https://wa.me/919102319329)
- Helpline (for backup): [+91 9102319329](tel:+919102319329)

Ensure you are on the legitimate domain and not a fake clone site.

## Step 2: Share Booking Details Using the Online Form

Whether you access via WhatsApp or the contact form, provide the following details:

```
Full Name:
Mobile Number:
Email ID:
Check-in Date:
Check-out Date:
Number of Guests:
Preferred Room Type (2 Bed AC, 4 Bed Non-AC, Deluxe, etc.):
Special Requests (elderly assistance, ground floor, group travel):
```

> Comment: Adding more context upfront speeds up confirmation because the trust can block the right room for you.

## Step 3: Receive Room Availability & Tariff

The booking desk replies within minutes (6 AM – 11 PM IST) with:

- Available room categories for your dates
- Total tariff including meals
- Check-in/check-out timings
- Payment instructions (shared only after you confirm)

## Step 4: Confirm Your Room Choice

Reply to the message or email with:

- Selected room category
- Number of rooms required
- Final guest count
- Preferred payment mode (UPI, bank transfer)

This triggers the generation of the official confirmation slip.

## Step 5: Review the Confirmation Slip

The trust sends a PDF/image containing:

- Booking ID (e.g., **SJM-2025-ONLINE-1205**)
- Guest names and stay dates
- Room type, occupancy, and meal plan
- Trust seal and contact details

Verify that the slip originates from **+91 9102319329** or the official trust email.

## Step 6: Complete Secure Online Payment

- Pay using the bank account or UPI ID provided in the same message thread.
- Beneficiary name should read **Sri Janaki Mahal Trust** or **Janaki Mahal Trust Ayodhya**.
- Share the payment screenshot or transaction reference to confirm.

> Flow Chart: Payment initiated → Proof shared → Trust verifies → Final confirmation issued.

## Step 7: Collect Final Travel Toolkit

After payment confirmation, the trust provides:

- Google Maps location of Sri Janaki Mahal Trust
- Reception contact for arrival coordination
- Meal timings and check-in checklist
- Emergency contact reminders

## Online Booking Tips

- Book 2-4 weeks ahead of your travel dates (earlier during peak season).
- Mention if you need airport or station pickup so the trust can coordinate drivers.
- For group bookings, attach a guest list in Excel/PDF for smoother check-in.
- Keep the WhatsApp chat/email thread handy for quick reference at the reception.
