# Janaki Mahal Trust - Booking via Travel Agent vs Direct (Which Is Safer?)

Sri Janaki Mahal Trust encourages direct booking. While some travel agents may claim to offer trust rooms, booking directly is safer and more transparent.

## Direct Booking Benefits

1. **Verified contact**: You deal only with [official channels](/official-booking) and [contact number](/contact-number).
2. **No markups**: Pay the trust’s actual [room rates](/rooms)—no agent commission.
3. **Clear confirmation**: You receive a trust-stamped confirmation you can validate via the [booking verification guide](/booking-verification-guide).
4. **Direct support**: Changes, queries, and issues go straight to the trust.

## Risks of Agent Booking

- **Fake agents**: Scammers pose as "authorized" agents and collect money without providing rooms.
- **Overbooking**: Agents may sell more rooms than available.
- **Wrong property**: You might end up at a different place than Sri Janaki Mahal Trust.
- **No recourse**: If the agent disappears, the trust cannot help with bookings it did not make.

## If You Must Use an Agent

If you use a tour operator or agent:
1. Ensure they book through the [official contact](/contact-number) and provide a trust confirmation.
2. Verify the confirmation format using the [booking verification guide](/booking-verification-guide).
3. Cross-check the beneficiary name for payment—must be **Sri Janaki Mahal Trust**.

## Trust’s Official Stance

The trust does not authorize any external agents. All genuine bookings are made through the trust’s own phone, WhatsApp, and email. For full verification, visit the [official page](/official).
