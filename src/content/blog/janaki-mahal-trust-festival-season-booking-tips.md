# Janaki Mahal Trust Festival Season Booking Tips - Secure Your Stay

Festival seasons in Ayodhya—especially **Ram Navami**, **Diwali**, and **Pran Pratishtha anniversaries**—attract millions of devotees. Follow these tips to secure rooms at **Janaki Mahal Trust** (also known as **Sri Janki Mahal Trust** and **Shri Janki Mahal Trust**).

> Flow Chart: Identify festival dates → Contact official helpline early → Receive confirmation → Complete advance payment → Enjoy stress-free darshan.

## 1. Book 60-90 Days in Advance

- Popular dates fill up rapidly. Call **+91 9102319329** at least two months ahead.
- Share alternate room preferences in case your first choice is taken.
- Provide full guest details to speed up confirmation.

## 2. Request a Festival Itinerary

- Ask the reception team for suggested darshan timings, aarti schedules, and traffic advisories.
- Plan your arrival a day early to avoid roadblocks and security restrictions.

## 3. Understand Payment Policies

- Festival bookings often require higher advance payments to guarantee rooms.
- Always pay via official links or bank details shared from the verified helpline or email.
- Save receipts and share payment confirmation via WhatsApp.

## 4. Coordinate Group Travel

- For yatri mandals or family groups, request adjacent rooms or an entire floor.
- Provide arrival times and transport requirements so the trust can prepare.

## 5. Leverage Meal Flexibility

- Inform dining staff about your festival itinerary for flexible meal timings.
- Request fasting-friendly food (sabudana, fruits, milk) in advance if required.

## 6. Late-Night Arrivals & Curfew Updates

- Security tightens during festivals. Call the trust if arriving after 10 PM so the gate team can assist.
- Carry printed confirmation slips and ID proofs for police checkpoints.

> Comment: Avoid relying on unverified agents promising “last-minute deals”—rooms are allocated only through official channels.
