# Janaki Mahal Trust Geyser & Hot Water Timings (When Is Hot Water Available?)

Hot water for bathing is available at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust. Here's what to expect regarding timings and usage.

## Hot Water Availability

The trust provides geyser facilities in rooms with attached bathrooms. Hot water is typically available during designated hours—often morning (5–9 AM) and evening (5–10 PM), subject to local supply.

**Confirm exact timings** with staff at check-in or via the [official contact](/contact-number).

## Usage Tips

1. **Plan your bath**: Use hot water during the announced windows.
2. **Conserve**: Geysers serve multiple guests; short showers help everyone.
3. **Winter**: In cold months, hot water is especially valued—plan accordingly.
4. **Issues**: Report any problem to reception; staff will assist.

## For Early Darshan

If you plan early morning Ram Mandir darshan, check if hot water is available before 5 AM. Staff can advise on the best time to bathe before leaving.

## Room Types

Hot water is available in rooms with attached bathrooms. See [room types](/rooms) and [attached bathroom guide](/blog/sri-janaki-mahal-trust-attached-bathroom-rooms) for options.
