# Janaki Mahal Trust Guest Registration & ID Check Process (What to Bring)

For safety and compliance, Sri Janaki Mahal Trust follows a simple guest registration and ID verification process at check-in. Here's what you need to know.

## Required Documents

Bring a valid government-issued ID for each adult guest:
- **Aadhaar card** (preferred)
- **Voter ID**
- **Passport**
- **Driving licence**

Photocopies are sometimes accepted for records, but originals may be checked. Have them ready to speed up check-in.

## Registration Steps

1. **Reception**: Present your [booking confirmation](/booking-verification-guide) and ID(s).
2. **Form filling**: Basic details—name, address, phone, dates of stay.
3. **Verification**: Staff may verify your booking against the official record.
4. **Room key and briefing**: You’ll receive room access and basic house rules.

## Why ID Check Matters

- **Security**: Ensures only booked guests stay on the premises.
- **Legal compliance**: Lodging establishments are required to maintain guest records.
- **Your safety**: Reduces risk of unauthorized occupancy.

## Children and Group Bookings

Children traveling with adults do not need separate ID. For group bookings, ensure the group leader has a confirmed [official booking](/official-booking) and IDs for all adults.

## Check-In Timings

Standard check-in is from 12 noon. If you arrive earlier, you may wait in the common area. See [check-in and check-out timings](/blog/sri-janaki-mahal-trust-check-in-check-out-timings) for details.
