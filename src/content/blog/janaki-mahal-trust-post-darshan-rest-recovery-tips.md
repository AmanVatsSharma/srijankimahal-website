# Janaki Mahal Trust Post-Darshan Rest & Recovery Tips

Long darshan queues and walking can be tiring. Sri Janaki Mahal Trust offers a place to rest and recover.

## Why Rest Matters

- **Queues**: Darshan can take hours
- **Walking**: Temple complex and parikrama involve walking
- **Heat**: Summer months can be exhausting
- **Elderly**: Seniors especially need rest—see [senior citizen guide](/blog/ayodhya-senior-citizen-pilgrimage-comfort-guide)

## At Sri Janaki Mahal Trust

- **Your room**: Rest in privacy; AC rooms help in summer
- **Meals**: Included—refuel without going out; see [meals guide](/blog/sri-janaki-mahal-trust-meals-food-guide)
- **Location**: Near Ram Mandir—short return after darshan
- **Hydration**: Drink water; trust provides [drinking water](/blog/sri-janaki-mahal-trust-drinking-water-filter-pure)

## Practical Tips

- **Stagger visits**: Don’t pack too many temples in one day
- **Afternoon rest**: Use midday for rest in summer
- **Foot care**: Comfortable footwear; elevate feet if swollen
- **Elderly**: Allow extra rest time; request ground floor—see [senior room preferences](/blog/janaki-mahal-trust-senior-citizen-room-floor-preferences)
