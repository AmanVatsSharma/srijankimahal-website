# Janaki Mahal Trust Power Backup & Generator Facility

Power cuts can occur in Ayodhya. Here's what to expect regarding backup power at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust.

## Backup Power

The trust has power backup arrangements to support essential operations during short power cuts. This helps maintain lights, fans, and basic facilities when the main supply is interrupted.

## What Is Typically Covered

- Common area lighting
- Essential room power (fans, lights)
- Reception and security systems

**Full AC backup** may not be available during prolonged cuts—inquire with [official contact](/contact-number) for current setup.

## For Charging Devices

Power cuts can affect charging. See [Ayodhya electricity and charging facilities](/blog/ayodhya-electricity-charging-facilities-guide) for tips on keeping phones and devices charged. Carry a power bank for critical devices during darshan.

## During Festivals

High demand can strain local power supply during festivals. Backup helps, but prepare for occasional disruptions. Plan important calls and charging during stable supply hours.

## Booking

Book your stay via [official booking](/official-booking) or [contact](/contact-number). Ask about backup facilities when you have special requirements.
