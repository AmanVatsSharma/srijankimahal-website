# Janaki Mahal Trust Receipt & Invoice - Booking Proof & Documentation

Proper receipt and invoice from Sri Janaki Mahal Trust protect you and serve as proof of payment. Here's what to expect.

Before payment, you receive a [booking confirmation](/booking-verification-guide) from the official number/email. It should include:

- Amount to be paid
- Payment instructions (beneficiary name: Sri Janaki Mahal Trust)

## After Payment

- **Receipt**: Request a receipt or acknowledgment after payment
- **Invoice**: For business or reimbursement, request a formal invoice
- **GST**: If applicable, the trust may provide GST invoice—inquire when you [book](/official-booking)

Contact the [official number](/contact-number) for current documentation process.

## Why It Matters

- **Proof of stay**: Needed for reimbursement, expense claims
- **Dispute resolution**: Helps if there is any confusion about payment or dates
- **Tax**: For some travelers, proper invoices support tax records
- **Scam protection**: Genuine trust bookings include proper documentation—see [how to avoid scams](/how-to-avoid-scams)

## If You Don't Receive It
