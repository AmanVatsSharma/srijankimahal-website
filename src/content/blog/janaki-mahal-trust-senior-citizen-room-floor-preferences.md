# Janaki Mahal Trust Senior Citizen Room & Floor Preferences

Sri Janaki Mahal Trust accommodates senior pilgrims. Here's how to get a suitable room.

## Room Preferences for Seniors

- **Ground floor**: Request ground-floor rooms to avoid stairs
- **Attached bathroom**: Convenient—see [attached bathroom rooms](/blog/sri-janaki-mahal-trust-attached-bathroom-rooms)

Specify these when you [book](/official-booking) or contact the [official number](/contact-number).

## Accessibility

## Meals and Rest

- Meals are included—served in a common area or as arranged
- Rest between darshan rounds—see [post-darshan rest tips](/blog/janaki-mahal-trust-post-darshan-rest-recovery-tips)
