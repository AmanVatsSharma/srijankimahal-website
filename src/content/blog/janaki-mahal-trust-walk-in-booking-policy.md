# Janaki Mahal Trust Walk-in Booking Policy (Can You Book on Arrival?)

Many pilgrims wonder if they can simply arrive at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust and get a room without prior booking. Here’s the policy and what to expect.

## Is Walk-in Booking Allowed?

Walk-in bookings are accepted **only when rooms are available**. The trust does not guarantee accommodation for unannounced arrivals. During festivals and weekends, rooms are usually fully booked, so walk-ins are rarely successful.

## When Walk-ins Might Work

- **Off-peak weekdays**: Occasionally there are last-minute cancellations.
- **Early morning**: If someone checks out early, a room might free up.
- **Non-festival periods**: Oct–Mar (excluding Ram Navami, Diwali, etc.) have better chances.

Even then, availability is uncertain. Advance booking is strongly recommended.

## Why Advance Booking is Better

1. **Guaranteed room**: No risk of arriving to find no vacancy.
2. **Peace of mind**: Confirmation before travel reduces stress.
3. **Better room choice**: You can select AC/non-AC and bed count in advance.
4. **Scam protection**: Official advance booking avoids fake on-the-spot offers.

Use the [official booking page](/official-booking) or [contact number](/contact-number) to book before you travel. For festivals, see the [festival booking guide](/festival-booking-guide).

## If You Arrive Without a Booking

1. Go to the trust reception and ask about availability.
2. If a room is free, staff may accommodate you—payment as per [room rates](/rooms).
3. If full, ask for waitlist or nearby alternatives. Never accept offers from people outside the trust premises—follow [how to avoid scams](/how-to-avoid-scams).

## Booking Verification for Walk-ins

If you get a room on arrival, ensure you receive proper documentation and receipt. Match payment details with the [official verification page](/official). Pay only to accounts in the name of Sri Janaki Mahal Trust.
