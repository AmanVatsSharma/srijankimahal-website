# Ram Janki Mahal vs Sri Janki Mahal Ayodhya - Are They the Same Trust?

Yes—many pilgrims use the search phrase **Ram Janki Mahal**, while official records and booking channels commonly use **Sri Janaki Mahal Trust** / **Sri Janki Mahal Trust**.  
In practical terms, devotees are usually referring to the same accommodation trust near Ram Mandir.

> Flow Chart: Search variant name → Verify official contact number → Confirm trust-stamped booking → Travel safely.

## Why So Many Name Variations Exist

Different regions and languages produce spelling differences:

- **Sri / Shri / Shree** (same honorific, different transliteration)
- **Janaki / Janki** (same devotional reference, pronunciation variation)
- **Ram Janki** (devotional combined phrase often used by pilgrims)

These variations are common in Ayodhya search behavior and do not always indicate different properties.

## How to Verify You Reached the Official Trust

Use this quick verification checklist before paying any advance:

1. Confirm the helpline is **+91 7759925612**
2. Confirm the official domain is **www.srijanakimahaltrustofficial.com**
3. Ask for a booking slip with trust details
4. Reject random third-party numbers claiming "exclusive booking rights"

## Common Search Queries Mapped to the Same Intent

- ram janki mahal ayodhya
- ram janki mahal trust contact number
- sri janki mahal trust ayodhya official
- shri janki mahal room booking

If you search any of these terms, still verify the same official contact details before proceeding.

## Anti-Scam Reminder for Devotees

- Never trust urgent payment pressure from unknown callers.

## Final Takeaway

For most pilgrims, **Ram Janki Mahal**, **Sri Janki Mahal**, and **Shri Janki Mahal** searches are all pathways to the same trust identity.  
Always verify first, then book through official channels to stay protected.
