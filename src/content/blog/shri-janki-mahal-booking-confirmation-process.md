# Shri Janki Mahal Booking Confirmation Process - Official Checklist

Every legitimate booking at **Shri Janki Mahal Trust** (also called **Sri Janaki Mahal Trust** and **Janaki Mahal Trust Ayodhya**) passes through a clear, verifiable confirmation process. Follow this checklist to ensure your reservation is authentic and protected from scams.

> Flow Chart: Submit booking request → Trust issues confirmation slip → Verify details → Pay via official channel → Receive final acknowledgement.

## Step 1: Submit Booking Request via Official Channels

- **Phone / Helpline:** [+91 7759925612](tel:+917759925612)
- **WhatsApp:** [https://wa.me/917759925612](https://wa.me/917759925612)
- **Email:** [srijanakimahaltrustofficial@gmail.com](mailto:srijanakimahaltrustofficial@gmail.com)

Provide your travel dates, guest count, preferred room type, and special requirements.

## Step 2: Receive Preliminary Availability Message

The trust confirms:

- Room type and tariff
- Check-in/check-out timings
- Meal plan and inclusions
- Advance payment requirement (if any)

## Step 3: Trust Generates Booking Confirmation Slip

Once you agree to the tariff, the trust sends a digital confirmation slip containing:

1. **Booking ID** – Unique code like `SJM-2025-0325-2AC`.
2. **Guest Details** – Names, check-in/check-out dates, room category.
3. **Contact Information** – Official helpline and WhatsApp number.
4. **Payment Summary** – Advance amount requested, balance payable at check-in (if applicable).
5. **Trust Seal** – Graphic stamp ensuring authenticity.

> Comment: The confirmation slip is always sent from **+91 7759925612** or the official email. Anything else is invalid.

## Step 4: Verify Every Detail on the Slip

- Double-check spellings of guest names and arrival dates.
- Ensure the room category matches your request (e.g., 3 Bed AC vs 3 Bed Non-AC).
- Confirm that meal inclusions and occupancy are stated clearly.
- Look for the trust seal and contact details footer.

If corrections are needed, reply immediately to the same message thread.

## Step 5: Complete Secure Payment

- Payment instructions include the bank/UPI details registered to **Sri Janaki Mahal Trust**.
- Never transfer funds to personal accounts or alternative numbers.
- Share payment proof (screenshot or transaction reference) in the same thread for quick verification.

> Flow Chart: Confirmation slip received → Details verified → Payment completed → Receipt acknowledged.

## Step 6: Receive Final Acknowledgement

After payment verification, the trust issues a final acknowledgement with:

- Payment status (paid/partial balance)
- Arrival instructions and check-in timing
- Google Maps location and parking guidance
- Emergency contact reminders

Save this message as it will be asked for during check-in.
