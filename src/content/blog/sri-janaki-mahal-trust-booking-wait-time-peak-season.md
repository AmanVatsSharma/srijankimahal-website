# Sri Janaki Mahal Trust Booking Wait Time During Peak Season

During festivals and long weekends, demand for rooms at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust spikes. Understanding wait times and response patterns helps you plan better and avoid frustration.

## Typical Response Times

- **Normal season**: Phone and WhatsApp usually get a response within minutes to an hour.
- **Peak season (Ram Navami, Diwali, etc.)**: Expect 2–6 hours or more due to high volume.
- **Email**: Within 24 hours in normal times; may extend during festivals.

Always use the [official contact number](/contact-number) or [official booking channel](/official-booking). Avoid unverified agents who promise "instant" confirmations—these can be scams (see [how to avoid scams](/how-to-avoid-scams)).

## Why Peak Season Takes Longer

The trust handles bookings manually to ensure accuracy. During festivals, hundreds of enquiries pour in daily. Staff prioritize genuine requests and verify each booking. This takes time but protects you from overbooking and fraud.

## How to Minimize Wait Time

1. **Book early**: For [festival booking](/festival-booking-guide), reserve 2–3 months ahead.
2. **Be clear in your message**: Include dates, guests, room preference (AC/non-AC) when you contact.
3. **Avoid duplicate requests**: Sending multiple messages slows the queue for everyone.
4. **Call during quieter hours**: Early morning (before 9 AM) or late evening sometimes has shorter queues.

## What to Expect During Confirmation

After availability is confirmed, you'll receive a booking message with dates, room type, and payment details. Verify using the [booking verification guide](/booking-verification-guide). Never pay before receiving the official confirmation format.

## If You're on a Tight Schedule

If you need a room urgently, try both phone and WhatsApp. Sometimes one channel responds faster. For verified options, check [official booking](/official-booking) and [room types](/rooms) to prepare your request in advance.
