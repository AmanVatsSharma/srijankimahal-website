# Sri Janaki Mahal Trust Drinking Water - Filter & Pure Water Facility

Safe drinking water is essential during pilgrimage. Here's what Sri Janaki Mahal Trust offers for guests.

## Water Facilities

The trust provides filtered/purified drinking water for guests. This helps ensure safe hydration during your stay. The exact type (RO, UV, or filter) may vary—ask staff at check-in.

## For Guests

- **Common areas**: Drinking water is typically available in common or dining areas
- **In-room**: Some rooms may have drinking water; otherwise use the common facility
- **Carry bottle**: Bring a reusable bottle to fill and carry during darshan

## Water Hygiene Tips

- Use only trust-provided or sealed bottled water
- Avoid tap water for drinking unless explicitly confirmed safe
- See [Ayodhya water hygiene tips](/blog/ayodhya-water-hygiene-tips-pilgrims) for general guidance

## During Summer

Hydration is important in hot months. Ensure you drink enough water before and after darshan. The trust’s water facility supports this need.
