# Sri Janaki Mahal Trust No-Deposit Booking - How It Works & Trust Policy

Many pilgrims ask whether Sri Janaki Mahal Trust requires an advance deposit. Here’s how the booking and payment process works.

## Deposit Policy

The trust’s policy may vary by season and room type. Generally:
- **Advance confirmation**: Some bookings may require payment or partial payment to confirm.
- **Pay on arrival**: In many cases, you can pay at check-in after verification.

Contact the [official booking](/official-booking) or [contact number](/contact-number) for the current policy when you book.

## When Payment Is Required

- **Festival period**: Advance payment is often needed to hold rooms during peak demand.
- **Long stays or groups**: May require advance confirmation with payment.
- **Short stays, off-peak**: Pay-on-arrival may be allowed.

Always confirm the exact payment terms when you receive your [booking confirmation](/booking-verification-guide).

## Safe Payment Methods

Pay only through channels specified in your confirmation:
- Bank transfer to **Sri Janaki Mahal Trust** or **Janaki Mahal Trust Ayodhya**
- UPI to the official trust account
- Cash at reception (if permitted)

Never pay to personal UPI IDs or unknown accounts. See [how to avoid scams](/how-to-avoid-scams).

## Receipt and Proof

After payment, collect a proper receipt or invoice. This serves as proof of booking and payment. Verify details on the [official page](/official) if anything seems unclear.

## Cancellation and Refunds

If your plans change, refer to the [cancellation and refund policy](/cancellation-refund). Advance payments may be refundable based on cancellation timing.
