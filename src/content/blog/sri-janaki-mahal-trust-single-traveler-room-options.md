# Sri Janaki Mahal Trust Single Traveler Room Options (Solo Pilgrim Guide)

Solo pilgrims are welcome at Sri Janaki Mahal Trust. Here's how to find the right room for a single traveler.

## Room Options for Solo Travelers

- **2-bed room (single occupancy)**: You may book a 2-bed room for yourself if you prefer privacy. Charges typically apply per room.
- **Sharing**: Some rooms allow sharing with other pilgrims—inquire when [booking](/official-booking). Cost-effective if you're comfortable sharing.
- **3-bed or 4-bed**: If traveling solo, you might share with a small group—ask about availability.

See [room types and prices](/rooms) for options.

## Cost Considerations

Single occupancy of a 2-bed room costs more per person than sharing. Sharing reduces cost. Contact the [official number](/contact-number) for current rates and availability.

## Safety for Solo Travelers

The trust is a safe, managed facility. For solo women travelers, see [solo women travel safety tips](/blog/ayodhya-solo-women-travel-safety-tips). Keep the [official contact](/contact-number) saved and share your stay details with family.

## Booking

Book via [official booking](/official-booking) or [contact](/contact-number). Specify "solo" or "single" so staff can suggest the best option.
