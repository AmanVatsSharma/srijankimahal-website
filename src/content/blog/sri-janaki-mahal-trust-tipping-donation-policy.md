# Sri Janaki Mahal Trust Tipping & Donation Policy

Sri Janaki Mahal Trust is a dharmshala serving pilgrims. Here's what to know about tipping and donations.

## Tipping

- **Not mandatory**: Staff are not dependent on tips
- **Optional**: If you wish to thank staff for extra help, a small gesture is your choice
- **No pressure**: The trust does not expect or demand tips

## Donations

- **Voluntary**: Donations to the trust support maintenance and service to pilgrims
- **Transparent**: If you donate, request a receipt for your records
- **Method**: Use official channels—cash at reception or transfer to the trust’s account. Never pay to individuals claiming to "collect for the trust"—verify via [official contact](/contact-number).

## Seva (Service)

- **Respect**: Treat staff and facilities with respect
- **Cleanliness**: Keep your room and common areas clean
- **Rules**: Follow check-in, check-out, and meal timings—see [check-in guide](/blog/sri-janaki-mahal-trust-check-in-check-out-timings)

## Booking

Room charges are separate from donations. Book via [official booking](/official-booking) or [contact](/contact-number). See [rooms](/rooms).
