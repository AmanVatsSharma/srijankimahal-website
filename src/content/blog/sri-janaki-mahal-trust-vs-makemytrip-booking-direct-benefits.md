# Sri Janaki Mahal Trust vs MakeMyTrip - Why Book Direct (Benefits & Safety)

Sri Janaki Mahal Trust is not listed on MakeMyTrip, Booking.com, or similar platforms. The trust handles all bookings directly. Here's why that's better for you.

## Trust Does Not Use OTAs

The trust manages reservations through its own channels: phone, WhatsApp, and email. This avoids:
- Third-party markups
- Overbooking
- Miscommunication
- Fake listings that imitate popular OTAs

## Benefits of Direct Booking

1. **No markups**: You pay the trust’s actual room rates. Check [room types and prices](/rooms) for current rates.
2. **Real-time availability**: Staff can confirm instantly whether a room is free.
3. **Verified confirmation**: You get a trust-stamped confirmation you can validate via the [booking verification guide](/booking-verification-guide).
4. **Direct support**: Questions about dates, rooms, or meals go straight to the trust—no middlemen.
5. **Scam protection**: Booking only through [official channels](/official-booking) and [contact number](/contact-number) keeps you safe. See [how to avoid scams](/how-to-avoid-scams).

## Fake OTA Listings

Scammers sometimes create fake listings on travel sites using the trust’s name and photos. If you see "Sri Janaki Mahal Trust" on MakeMyTrip, Goibibo, or similar, it is likely fraudulent. Always use the [official page](/official) to verify before paying.

## How to Book Directly

1. Call or WhatsApp **+91 9893563047**
2. Or use the [official booking page](/official-booking) for the full process
3. Receive confirmation from the trust’s official number/email
4. Pay only to accounts named **Sri Janaki Mahal Trust**
