# Sri Ram Janmotsav Ayodhya - Booking Early Advice & Janaki Mahal Stay

Sri Ram Janmotsav (Ram Navami) is one of Ayodhya’s biggest festivals. Booking early is essential for a comfortable stay.

## Why Book Early

- **Demand**: Rooms sell out months before the event
- **Choice**: Early booking lets you choose room type—see [rooms](/rooms)
- **Peace of mind**: Confirmed stay means you can focus on darshan
- **Avoid scams**: Official advance booking reduces exposure to fraud—[how to avoid scams](/how-to-avoid-scams)

## How Early to Book

**2–3 months in advance** is recommended. Contact [official booking](/official-booking) or [contact number](/contact-number) as soon as dates are confirmed.

## What to Expect

- Large crowds
- Extended darshan queues
- Higher demand for transport and accommodation
